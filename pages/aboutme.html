<body id="aboutmetext">
      Welcome to my about page! My psudonym is KittKat, and I'm a web-based artist 
      <br><br>
<img src="../pics/pfp.png" height="30%" width="30%">
      <br><br>
      I live in SoCal, where my primary hobbies are my artwork (which takes up a large portion of my free time and spare time) and my beloved cats. 
      <br><br>
      Some of the many topics on which I not only make art but know a lot about include video games, cats, and many Youtube creators. 
      <br><br>
      My current dream is to transfer to San Diego State University. The art studio, classes, and programs there are exactly what I<br>
      want for my future. In the meantime, I'm still making commission art for you and anyone else who wants it!
      <br><br>
      I am currently working on becoming the best professional artist I can possibly be, and the fact that your here means that you may have some 
      interest in hiring me for some work. <br>
      If so, please feel free to browse my work on the other pages, or head over to Social Media to find more ways to contact me about pricing!
